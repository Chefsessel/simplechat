# simplechat
A simple php-based chat using a bit of jQuery and writing the chatlog to file. Been using it at work to chat with a handful of collegues. It doesn't scale and beware that resource-hungry setInterval() function at the end for refreshing the chat window contents.

## Contents / Inhalt ##
chatlog.html	(keeps what was written)

index.php	(does all the work)

post.php	(for posting msg to chatlog)

style.css (it's obvious, c'mon)

Just upload it to your webserver (or your local server with e.g. xampp).
